## Session Changes - Unified Mapper Screen Enhancements

### Mapping Row and Picklist Improvements
1. Removed the "Map Fields" row since the functionality was moved to the column headers
2. Added a fixed height (56px) for the column headers to prevent overflow issues
3. Improved the column header layout:
   - Field name with required indicator (red star) and info tooltip
   - Small gap (2px) between title and dropdown
   - Fixed height dropdown (24px) with consistent styling

### Enhanced Dropdown Functionality
1. Implemented a searchable dropdown with sample data:
   - Shows field names and their values from the first record
   - Added search functionality that filters by both field names and values
   - Improved visibility with a wider dialog (400px)
   - Added autofocus to the search field for immediate typing

### Visual and UX Improvements
1. Added a clear button (x) next to mapped fields:
   - Small icon (16px) that appears only when a mapping exists
   - Aligned with the dropdown height
   - Removes the mapping and updates the unsaved changes state
2. Improved spacing and alignment:
   - Reduced vertical padding to prevent overflow
   - Consistent horizontal spacing
   - Better alignment of all elements

### Bug Fixes
1. Fixed overflow issues in the column headers
2. Resolved layout issues with the mapping interface
3. Improved the drag-and-drop target area for better usability

### State Management
1. Maintained proper state updates when:
   - Adding mappings through the dropdown
   - Removing mappings with the clear button
   - Ensuring unsaved changes are tracked correctly
