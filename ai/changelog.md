# Saved Mappings Feature Changelog

## Summary
Implemented Phase 1 of the saved mappings feature and completed Phase 2 with reusable UI components and screen implementation. The implementation follows a component-driven workflow, with each component being built and tested independently before integration. Phase 3 has been completed with enhanced input handling and Phase 4 with bulk operations. Phase 5 is now underway with code refactoring and optimization.

## Completed Items

### Phase 1: State Management âœ…
- âœ… Created `SavedMapping` model class with:
  - Required fields (name, product, query, mappings, etc.)
  - JSON serialization methods (toJson/fromJson)
  - CopyWith functionality for immutable updates
  - Name length validation (max 200 characters)
  - Added raw samples storage for Elastic data
- âœ… Implemented `SavedMappingsState` class with core functionality:
  - Create new saved mapping with unique name handling
  - Update existing mapping
  - Delete mapping with undo capability
  - Duplicate mapping with automatic name generation
  - Bulk delete mappings
  - Query duplicate detection
- âœ… Added comprehensive unit tests:
  - Test coverage for all state management operations
  - Edge case handling (unique names, undo functionality)
  - All tests passing successfully

### Phase 2: Saved Events Screen âœ…
- âœ… Created reusable UI components:
  - `SavedMappingTableRow`: Display individual mapping entries
  - `SavedMappingTableHeader`: Sortable column headers with selection
  - `SelectionHeader`: Bulk action controls for selected items
- âœ… Added comprehensive component tests:
  - Test rendering and layout
  - Test user interactions (clicks, selections)
  - Test callback handling
  - All component tests passing
- âœ… Implemented SavedMappingsScreen:
  - Integration of all reusable components
  - Screen-level state management for selection and sorting
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
  - Empty states and loading states
- âœ… Added screen-level tests:
  - Test component integration
  - Test selection workflows
  - Test sorting functionality
  - Test bulk operations
  - All screen tests passing

### Phase 3: Enhanced Input Handling âœ…
- âœ… Enhanced Request/Response input fields:
  - Added required field validation
  - Added visual indicators (red star) for required fields
  - Disabled Parse button until all required fields are populated
- âœ… Updated Parse functionality:
  - Store raw sample records based on selected limit
  - Clear Request/Response fields after successful parse
  - Maintain current mapping until new Parse or Load action
  - Validate Event Name is populated
- âœ… Enhanced save/load workflow:
  - Store raw samples with mapping
  - Load and display raw samples in table
  - Maintain re-mapping capability
  - Handle field mapping updates

### Phase 4: Bulk Operations âœ…
- âœ… Implemented bulk delete functionality:
  - Added `BulkDeleteDialog` component for confirmation
  - Enhanced `SavedMappingsState` with bulk delete methods
  - Added undo capability for bulk deletes
  - Added success feedback via snackbar
- âœ… Added selection management:
  - Implemented select/deselect all functionality
  - Added individual selection toggles
  - Added selection count display
  - Added clear selection capability
- âœ… Enhanced UI for bulk operations:
  - Added visual feedback for selected items
  - Added bulk action buttons in selection header
  - Added disabled states for empty selections
  - Maintained consistent styling with app theme

### Phase 5: Code Refactoring and Optimization ðŸš§
- âœ… Created reusable mixins:
  - `ElasticDataMixin`: Handles elastic data parsing and management
  - `MappingStateMixin`: Manages mapping state and operations
  - Added comprehensive documentation
  - Ensured type safety and null safety
- âœ… Extracted UI components:
  - `ElasticInputSection`: Handles elastic request/response input
  - `CustomScrollBehavior`: Manages cross-platform scrolling
  - Improved component reusability
  - Added proper widget documentation
- âœ… Enhanced type safety:
  - Created type-safe enums for field categories, mapping modes, token types
  - Added product types and field types enums
  - Implemented structured classes for mapping keys and elastic fields
  - Created record-like classes for configuration (table, animation, API, cache)
  - Refactored constants to use type-safe definitions
- ðŸš§ Ongoing optimizations:
  - State management improvements
  - Performance enhancements
  - Code organization
  - Component isolation

## Changelog

### Configuration Field State Management Investigation
- Identified issue with configuration fields not being saved correctly within each saved mapping
- Added unit tests to validate state management for saved mappings
- Added UI tests to verify configuration field persistence
- Discovered that only eventType configuration field is saving correctly per-mapping
- Created test cases to verify loading and unloading of mappings with different configuration fields

### High Priority TODOs
- [HIGH] Fix configuration field state management to ensure all fields (not just eventType) are properly scoped to each mapping
  - Issue: Configuration fields are behaving globally instead of being specific to each saved mapping
  - Impact: Configuration fields are not persisting correctly when switching between mappings
  - Required Changes:
    - Review and update _handleConfigFieldChange method
    - Ensure proper initialization of configuration fields in _loadMappingData
    - Verify configuration field persistence in _saveMapping and _saveCurrentMapping
    - Add additional validation in state management layer

### Test Coverage
- Added comprehensive test suite for saved mappings state management
- Created UI tests for configuration field persistence
- Implemented test cases for save, load, change, save, load cycle
- Added tests to verify independent configuration field values across mappings

### Code Improvements
- Updated SavedMapping model to properly handle configuration fields
- Enhanced SavedMappingsState to manage mapping-specific configuration fields
- Improved configuration field initialization and loading logic
- Added proper state management for configuration field changes

## Next Steps
- Complete Phase 5 refactoring:
  - Create configuration mixin
  - Extract additional UI components
  - Add performance optimizations
  - Complete documentation
- Implement browser persistence:
  - Add localStorage integration
  - Add state recovery on app load
  - Handle version migrations
  - Add error recovery
