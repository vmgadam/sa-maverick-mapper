# Saved Mappings Feature Changelog

## Summary
Implemented Phase 1 of the saved mappings feature and completed Phase 2 with reusable UI components and screen implementation. The implementation follows a component-driven workflow, with each component being built and tested independently before integration.

## Completed Items

### Phase 1: State Management ✅
- ✅ Created `SavedMapping` model class with:
  - Required fields (name, product, query, mappings, etc.)
  - JSON serialization methods (toJson/fromJson)
  - CopyWith functionality for immutable updates
  - Name length validation (max 200 characters)
- ✅ Implemented `SavedMappingsState` class with core functionality:
  - Create new saved mapping with unique name handling
  - Update existing mapping
  - Delete mapping with undo capability
  - Duplicate mapping with automatic name generation
  - Bulk delete mappings
  - Query duplicate detection
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests:
  - Test coverage for all state management operations
  - Edge case handling (unique names, undo functionality)
  - All tests passing successfully

### Phase 2: Saved Events Screen ✅
- ✅ Created reusable UI components:
  - `SavedMappingTableRow`: Display individual mapping entries
  - `SavedMappingTableHeader`: Sortable column headers with selection
  - `SelectionHeader`: Bulk action controls for selected items
- ✅ Added comprehensive component tests:
  - Test rendering and layout
  - Test user interactions (clicks, selections)
  - Test callback handling
  - All component tests passing
- ✅ Implemented SavedMappingsScreen:
  - Integration of all reusable components
  - Screen-level state management for selection and sorting
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
  - Empty states and loading states
- ✅ Added screen-level tests:
  - Test component integration
  - Test selection workflows
  - Test sorting functionality
  - Test bulk operations
  - All screen tests passing

### Phase 3: Save/Load Flow (In Progress)
- ✅ Created SaveAsDialog component:
  - Name input with automatic length enforcement (max 200 chars)
  - Loading state during save operation
  - Error handling for duplicate names
  - Form validation and error messages
- ✅ Added comprehensive dialog tests:
  - Test form validation
  - Test name length enforcement
  - Test duplicate name handling
  - Test loading states
  - All dialog tests passing
- ✅ Integrated with UnifiedMapperScreen:
  - Created SavedMappingsSection component to replace Current Mappings
  - Added search and filter functionality with real-time updates
  - Implemented sorting by name, product, fields, and dates
  - Added selection management with bulk actions
  - Integrated duplicate query detection
  - Added comprehensive tests for all new functionality

## Next Steps
- Continue Phase 3: Save/Load Flow
  - Implement DuplicateQueryDialog component
  - Add mapping switch confirmation
  - Complete integration tests for save/load workflows
