# Code Improvement Priority Tiers

## Tier 1: Essential Improvements (No-Brainers)
These changes will significantly improve code maintainability and performance with minimal risk:

### Code Organization and Cleanup
- Extract the massive UnifiedMapperScreen into smaller widgets:
  - Create `InputSourceSelector` widget
  - Create `MappingsDisplay` widget
  - Create `EventsTable` widget
- Remove unused code and imports
- Fix current linter warnings
- Extract magic numbers and strings into constants

### Performance Quick Wins
- Use `ListView.builder` where we're mapping lists
- Add proper keys for widget reconciliation
- Use const constructors where possible
- Cache computed values that don't need to be recalculated every build

### Error Handling Basics
- Add basic error boundaries for critical sections
- Improve error messages for user-facing errors
- Add basic input validation
- Clean up error logging

### Table Implementation
- Replace custom table implementation with Flutter's `PaginatedDataTable`:
  - Built-in support for fixed headers
  - Better performance with large datasets
  - Native scrolling behavior

## Tier 2: Worth Considering
These improvements offer good value but require more careful consideration:

### State Management
- Move mapping logic into a dedicated service class
- Create proper state classes instead of using strings
- Consider moving to Riverpod for specific complex state scenarios

### API Improvements
- Use dio instead of http for better features
- Add basic retry logic for API calls
- Create basic data models for critical structures

### SearchableDropdown Improvements
- Consider using Flutter's native `SearchAnchor` widget
- Add basic keyboard navigation
- Improve focus management

### Configuration
- Move configuration fields into a dedicated service
- Add basic validation for configuration values
- Implement simple persistence for settings

## Tier 3: Nice to Have (Overkill for MVP)
These are good practices but may be overkill for the current stage:

### Advanced Features
- Full test coverage
- CI/CD setup
- Advanced accessibility features
- Feature flags
- Environment configurations
- Advanced security measures

### Architecture
- Full feature folder reorganization
- Shared UI package
- Advanced error hierarchies
- Complete API client package

### Documentation
- Full API documentation
- Architecture decision records
- Extensive usage examples
- Package-level documentation

### Advanced Optimizations
- Advanced list virtualization
- Complex caching strategies
- Advanced state management patterns
- Advanced error recovery strategies

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with Tier 1 improvements - these are low-hanging fruit that will give immediate benefits
2. Evaluate Tier 2 improvements based on specific pain points as they arise
3. Keep Tier 3 improvements in mind for future scaling but don't implement prematurely

Remember: The goal is to maintain a balance between code quality and development speed. Focus on improvements that solve real problems rather than theoretical ones.
